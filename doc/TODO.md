# TODO List

## Enhancements requests
* Internationalization
* Test on Safari, Opera
* Better management of skins (load only one skin at a time instead of all)
* Better synchronization management of the notebook tree (when sync starts, the local version erases the one stored in database, possibly leading to losing access to notebooks)
* When deleting a notebook, propose to attach notes and sub-books to the parent.


## New features requests
* Crypt content when stored in a remote db
* Enable drag&drop of a note on a notebook
* Implement tags
* Add account management (be able to manage several accounts on one CouchDB server)
* Create a mobile application
* Test with CouchBase, PouchDB Server and Cloudant database servers
* Implement search in notes
* Add a "share" button to copy the link of a note or a notebook

## Bugs
* Probably don't work on IE (not tested)
* css need some fix in Firefox
* Fix css for the loading message
 
## Ideas
* Mix list of notes inside the notebook tree
* Use Bootstrap for Angular

## Development and Code quality
* Test real time update/sync between 2 browsers
* Implement end to end (e2e) tests
* Manage css for tree node at the right place
* Check security in depth
