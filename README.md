# KNOT NOTES ![](https://github.com/leolivier/knot-note/raw/master/src/assets/images/knot-note-48x48.png)

Yet another note editor (more or less evernote like)...

Knot-notes is able to store the notes locally in the browser's own database and is also able to store the notes in a CouchDB database on your own server.

It is written with the help of

* Angular (v4) for the GUI, 
* PouchDB (for local database and syncing)
* and CouchDB (for server database).

##Installing 

##Local database install only

*With this kind of install, you can save your notes inside your browser only. You can't share your notes in another browser or on another device.*

* You must have an http server installed (Apache, NGinx, ...)
* Download the [1.0.alpha-3 release](https://github.com/leolivier/knot-notes/raw/master/knot-notes-1.0.0-a3.zip) zip file, 
unzip it in a new directory.
* If necessary, manage the server configuration so that the new directory can be accessed and manage fallback to index.html (see [server configuration](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/deployment.html#!#fallback) on Angular documentation). 
* If you serve the application from a sub directory of your server root directory (i.e. the url is not at the root of the domain), you must change the base href in index.html to reflect the correct base.
* That's it!

###Server database

*With this install, you can share your notes between different devices and browsers.*

* First, proceed to the *Local database install* described above.
* See [CouchDB site](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/latest/) for learning how to install and run CouchDB (I did it on a raspberrypi 2 and it works like a charm). 

*This should also work with all databases compatible with [PouchDB](https://pouchdb.com) (CouchBase, Cloudant) but has not been tested yet.*

* Create your own Couchdb database named 'knot-notes'
* Fill the settings in the application for its url (__not__ including the database name), and credentials. __Warning:__ these credentials are currently stored unencrypted in the local database!
